<h3>I don't study exoplanets. Can I participate in ERES?</h3>
<p>ERES is open to all early-career scientists, researchers, and students working on anything related to planets and planetary systems, broadly construed. In addition to exoplanets, relevant areas of research may include (but are not limited to) star and planet formation and evolution (including disks); stellar astrophysics; planetary science and Solar System exploration; astrobiology and the search for life beyond Earth; geological, oceanic, and atmospheric sciences; celestial mechanics and astrodynamics; and aerospace engineering. </p>

<h3>Can I register/participate without submitting an abstract?</h3>
<p>Yes. However, we strongly encourage submitting an abstract if you can. We may not be able to provide lodgings or travel support for participants who do not submit abstracts.</p>

<h3>Is there a registration or abstract submission fee?</h3>
<p>No. Registration and abstract submission is free of charge for all participants.</p>

<h3>Is there a virtual/remote attendance option?</h3>
<p>No. ERES IX will be a fully in-person event. </p>

<h3>How many slots are there for oral presentations? What about poster presentations?</h3>
<p>The SOC will decide the number of talks on the schedule after abstracts have been received, sorted, and reviewed. We anticipate that everyone who submits a reasonable, relevant abstract will be offered an opportunity to present at the conference.</p>

<h3>How do you pronouce ERES?</h3>
<p>We are going with the pronunciation "EE-rehz" (IPA spelling: /'ir&#603;z/). Some of us who were around for ERES V in 2019 remember it being pronounced "AIR-eez" (/&#603;&#601;ri&#720;z/, like the name "Ares"). </p>
