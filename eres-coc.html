        <h1>ERES 2024 @ Cornell — Code of Conduct</h1>
        <p>Emerging Researchers in Exoplanet Science Symposium (ERES) 2024 is dedicated to fostering a professional environment that values respect, equal opportunity, and fair treatment for all participants. This includes everyone involved in ERES 2024, from the organizing committee to all attendees.  We follow the guidelines outlined in the <a href="https://aas.org/policies/ethics">AAS Code of Ethics</a> as well as in <a href="https://policy.cornell.edu/policy-library/standards-ethical-conduct">Cornell's Standards of Ethical Conduct</a>.</p>
          
        <p></p>To be more specific, all participants are expected to adhere to the following principles:</p>
        
        <h2>Respect for Individuals</h2>
        <p>All individuals should be treated with respect in professional settings. Any form of abusive, demeaning, humiliating, or intimidating behavior is unacceptable. This includes actions based on gender, race, ethnicity, national origin, religion, age, marital status, sexual orientation, gender identity, disability, veteran status, or any other protected category.</p>

        <h2>Prohibited Behaviors</h2>
        <p>ERES 2024 strictly forbids behaviors that are harmful or inappropriate, including:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Harassment:</strong> Any form of harassment based on race, religion, color, gender, age, national origin, disability, marital status, sexual orientation, gender identity, or any other protected class is prohibited. This encompasses verbal harassment (e.g., offensive comments, slurs), nonverbal harassment (e.g., inappropriate written or graphic material), and physical harassment (e.g., physical assault or invasion of personal space).</li>
            <li><strong>Sexual Harassment:</strong> Unwelcome sexual advances, requests for sexual favors, and other verbal or physical conduct of a sexual nature that create a hostile or offensive environment are unacceptable. This includes any behavior that interferes with an individual’s professional performance.</li>
            <li><strong>Bullying:</strong> Bullying behavior, including any actions that demean, intimidate, or undermine others, whether individually or in groups, is not allowed. This includes verbal bullying (e.g., threats, insults), physical bullying (e.g., pushing, assault), and other intimidating behaviors.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h2>Promotion of Open Dialogue</h2>
        <p>ERES 2024 supports the free expression and exchange of scientific ideas. Participants should cultivate an environment where open discussion and respectful disagreement are encouraged, regardless of differing opinions.</p>
        
        <h2>Maintaining Professionalism & Collaborative Environment</h2>
        <p>All attendees should act with professionalism, showing respect and refraining from discriminatory, harassing, or abusive behavior. A positive and inclusive atmosphere should be maintained for all participants. Moreover, a collaborative and collegial environment should be promoted, encouraging constructive discussions, idea exchange, and respectful debate. Diversity of opinions and backgrounds should be respected, avoiding behaviors that could harm professional relationships or create a hostile environment.</p>
        
        <h2>Responsibilities of Senior Participants</h2>
        <p>Senior members and research supervisors have a duty to support the research, educational, and professional growth of students and junior colleagues. This includes creating safe and supportive work environments, properly acknowledging contributions, and protecting academic freedom. Supporting the career goals of students and young professionals, whether in academia or other fields, is also crucial.</p>
        
        <h2>Ethical Presentation</h2>
        <p>Presenters must adhere to ethical standards when presenting and publishing research. Proper citation of others’ work, avoiding plagiarism, and accurate representation of research findings are essential. Disclosures of potential conflicts of interest are required, and exaggeration or misrepresentation of research is prohibited.</p>
        
        <h2>Respect for Intellectual Property</h2>
        <p>Attendees must respect others’ intellectual property rights, including not using or sharing others’ data, results, or ideas without permission. Protecting one's own intellectual property through appropriate measures is also important.</p>
        
        <h2>Responsible Research Conduct</h2>
        <p>Research should be conducted ethically, transparently, and reproducibly. This involves following appropriate methodologies, responsibly handling data and materials, and maintaining integrity in reporting findings.</p>
        
        <h2>Legal and Regulatory Compliance</h2>
        <p>Participants must comply with all relevant laws, regulations, and policies, including those related to ethics, data protection, safety, and intellectual property. This includes obtaining necessary permissions and adhering to local or regional regulations.</p>
        
        <h2>Virtual Interactions</h2>
        <p>This code of conduct extends to virtual interactions on the conference’s Slack workspace and other online platforms. Participants should maintain a respectful and professional environment, use appropriate language, follow channel guidelines, maintain confidentiality, be collaborative, and report inappropriate behavior.</p>
        
        <h2>Reporting Misconduct</h2>
        <p>Any breaches of the code of conduct should be reported promptly. ERES 2024 takes such reports seriously and will address them appropriately, which may include warnings, removal from the conference, or other actions.</p>
